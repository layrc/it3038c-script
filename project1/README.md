United States Time Zones Script

Intro
 * The time.sh script is a script that was written in bash on a CentOS machine. This script tells you the current time in all six United States time zones.

To create this script:
 * Create a new file called time.sh or something similar
 * Copy and Paste the script code from time.sh to the new file you created
 * Write and quit that file

To run this script:
 * Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located
 * Run bash time.sh  or bash name_of_file.sh

The output should look something like this:
```
  The current time in Eastern Time Zone is: 06:39:16 PM
  The current time in Central Time Zone is: 05:39:16 PM
  The current time in Mountain Time Zone is: 04:39:16 PM
  The current time in Pacific Time Zone is: 03:39:16 PM  
  The current time in Alaska Time Zone is: 02:39:16 PM
  The current time in Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone is: 01:39:16 PM
```
