Lab 7

I have created 3 different python scripts that edits .jpg images you have saved on your computer. This python script uses a plugin called Pillow.

Before you began:
* Step 1: Make sure you have python installed
```
python --version
```
* Step 2: Make sure pip is installed
```
curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"

python get-pip.py
```
* Step 3: Install pillow using pip
```
pip install pillow
```

Once you have completed those steps, you will need to create a new .py file using a text editor of your choice
```
sudo vim file_name.py
```
* Copy and paste the script into that file 
* Within each of the scripts you will see two example.jpg, this is where you add the image you want to edit

To run this script in the Terminal:
```
python file_name.py
```

The output will show you the edited image
