Lab 7

I have created three different python scripts that edits pictures you have saved on your computer.

Before you began:
* Step one make sure pip is installed
```
curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"

python get-pip.py
```
* Step two install pillow using pip
```
pip install pillow
```

Once you have pillow installed, you will need to create a new .py file
Within that file, copy and paste the script

You will need to edit each script to add the image you want to change.
